<div>
    This is a sample app showing how simple it is to access Drive using ngDrive. In this case it is listing all drive files.<br>
    All of the code is in minimal.html. When I say "all of the code", it's only two lines!!! How cool is that.<br><br>
    <li ng-repeat="file in $ctrl.filesArray">{{file.title}}</li>
</div>
